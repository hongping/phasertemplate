This repository act as the basic project template for Phaser game engine. The template used Phaser game engine v2.0.5 hosted on CDNJS.

The "Game" is consisted of 5 stages, by sequence:
1. Boot -> load the assets for "Preload" stage, as well as setup global required variables
2. Preload -> preload asset
3. MainMenu -> intro scene
4. Game -> main game logic goes here
5. GameOver -> after game, for highscores, etc.

The Setup.js will combined all the stages and setup the HTML element where Phaser will insert the canvas/WebGL.
